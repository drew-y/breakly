Breakly is a menubar app that  uses macOS's native notifications system to remind you to stand up every 20 minutes or so. It is helpful tool for those looking to follow the [20-20-20 rule](http://www.labnol.org/software/computer-eye-exercise/14069/), those looking to avoid the negative effects of sitting too long by standing for [two minutes every twenty minutes](http://www.npr.org/2012/05/09/152336802/stand-up-walk-around-even-just-for-20-minutes), or for those that just have difficulty remembering to take a break.
