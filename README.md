# Breakly - Reminders for your health on macOS

Breakly is a menubar app that  uses macOS's native notifications system to remind you to stand up every 20 minutes or so. 

Use it if you are:
- Looking to save your eyesight with the [20-20-20 rule](http://www.labnol.org/software/computer-eye-exercise/14069/)
- Looking to avoid the negative effects of sitting with the [stand two minutes every twenty minutes rule](http://www.npr.org/2012/05/09/152336802/stand-up-walk-around-even-just-for-20-minutes)
- Or just have trouble remembering to take a break every once in awhile.
